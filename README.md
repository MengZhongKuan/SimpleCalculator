# SimpleCalculator
A simple calculator project capable of performing basic arithmetics and logical units are implemented on a DE-10 board using the Quartus Lite II program with Verilog.  
The program (after running) shows the first operand on the first two 7-segment display, the second operand on the middle two 7-segment display and the results in the final two 7-segment display. 
Detailed description of the project can be sound in the Microsoft words document.
Note that the program cannot display number more than 99 on each of the display.
